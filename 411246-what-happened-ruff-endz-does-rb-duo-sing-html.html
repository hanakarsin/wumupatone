They grew up in the same community under influencers like Marvin Gaye and the gospel group Commissioned. By the age of 14, Dante was already part of a group comprising much older members known as Total Male. By then, he was totally into the street life and had abandoned school completely.</p><p class=align-left>But while in the group, he realized how important it was for him to buckle down and get his high school diploma, so he did just that. On his first day back to school, he met David, who happened to be hanging out in the music room. At one time, both his parents sang professionally, so he grew up around plenty of music. His dad was a preacher and raised the family on gospel music.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d165f57eef33e1aa.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Manwell Reyes: 5 little-known facts about Angela Johnson's husband</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0bf4342c17f2a948.jpeg><p class=align-left>Despite the religious background, Davinch got his fill of secular music and drew inspiration from artists like Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder.

They eventually put up a <a href=# title="What happened to Ruff Endz" rel="nofollow noopener">quartet </a>together known as Ultimate Condition, and their undeniable talent caught the attention of Patti LaBelle, with whom they formed a team. But due to their differences, nothing really panned out.</p><p class=align-left>Things didn’t get rolling until they met another Baltimore singer called Rufus Waller or Scola, the former member of the RnB group Dru Hill.

Their stage name perfectly describes the daily hustle they had to go through to realize their dream. It was literally “rough making ends meet.” The duo got to work right away writing and recording their own material. Unfortunately, the money was not rolling in yet, so they worked regular nine to five.</p><p class=align-left>The first demo that they put together did not get them anywhere. But even though they felt discouraged, they decided to persevere. Then <a href=# title="What happened to Ruff Endz" rel="nofollow noopener">came Oji Pierce</a>, a songwriter, and producer, who scrapped the duo’s demo and made a new one. They brought the new product to Epic Records in 1999. They blew everyone away with their live performance and were signed immediately.</p><h2>Ruff Endz hit songs</h2><p class=align-left>Ruff Endz poured their heart and soul into the music because they were hungry for success and had first-hand experiences of the violence and chaos that rocked their hometown. Their only ticket out of this lifestyle was to make it big in the music industry.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/6386279f0a3e462e.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Johnny Depp and Winona Ryder relationship explained</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d165f57eef33e1aa.jpeg><p class=align-left>While working on their debut album, they got the opportunity to appear on Freak, their label-made Camron single. Ruff ends then released their debut single, <i>No More</i>. Music lovers couldn’t get enough of their fantastic sound, the mix of David’s smooth tenor and Dante’s rich baritone. The track became an instant hit, picking at <a href=# title="What happened to Ruff Endz" rel="nofollow noopener">number five</a> on Billboard Hot 100 and topped the RnB charts.</p><p class=align-left><i>No More </i>was not their choice for their debut. But after it began to circulate to club and radio DJs and generate a lot of buzz, they just ran with it. Their debut album, <i>Love Crimes</i>, was released two months later. They also released a follow-up single, <i>Where Does Love Go from Here</i>, but it didn’t chart.</p><p class=align-left>After a lengthy tour and all the inspiration and ideas they garnered along the way, they wasted no time getting back to the studio to begin working on their Sophomore album. The following year, the album’s first single dubbed <i>Cash Money Cars Clothes</i>, featuring Memphis Bleak, dropped without much fanfare.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/36ffa384c7db50cf.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello love story and relationship: Are they still together?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>It was not until a year later, when they released <i>Someone to Love You</i>, that they reignited the flame. This track took them to the charts, and their album bearing the same name was released after that. But, unfortunately, this was to be their last project then.</p><h2>What happened to Ruff Endz?</h2><p class=align-left>In 2003, the duo decided to take a break after personal and <a href=#>business</a> issues with their label came between them. The same year, a compilation album of greatest hits was released to the shock of many since the group had only put out two albums by that time. But this album seemed to be an easy and convenient way to honour their final contract with Epic Records.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/720/08dd3dd46dd8bc28.jpeg><p class=align-left>But their break took longer than any of them or their fans had anticipated. In a past interview, David explained that they had parted ways with Sony and were seeking other alternatives. However, both of them were experiencing hiccups in their personal lives, with each having lots of things going on. As a result, they separated to focus on their personal and family matters.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/bcf4105f572a62bc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 20 sad classic rock songs of all time</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The next couple of years saw both artists pursue solo careers.

He also became an independent filmmaker and worked on several<a href=# title="What happened to Ruff Endz" rel="nofollow noopener"> short films</a>. Dante also did his own thing, working with artists like Cool and The Gang and Slave.</p><h2>New beginnings</h2><p class=align-left>Later, Ruff Endz was back, but not the duo the fans recognized. Dante wanted to get the group back together, but his former partner made it clear that he was content with what he was doing and no longer had any interest in the group thing. So, with his blessing, Dante decided to carry on without him and bring a new member on board, fellow Baltimorean <a href=# title="What happened to Ruff Endz" rel="nofollow noopener">Will Carter</a> or "Will Star."</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/fd17415ef49388bc.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>15 top best trending Joseph Hill Culture songs</span></p></a><p class=align-left>But the new development ended as quickly as it started since a terrible event on the horizon would emotionally reunite the two original members. After years of handling solo projects, David and Dante were finally motivated to reunite for a good cause. This was during the Baltimore riots due to the controversial death of Freddie Gray in 2016. The duo released the single, A Time for Change.</p><p class=align-left>When their fans were least expecting it, Ruff Endz new album Soul Brothers was released. This was their first studio album in eight years. In an interview, Dante described the album's vibe, mentioning that the release was rated “P” for positive.
